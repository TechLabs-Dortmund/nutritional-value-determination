# Nutritional Value Determination with Photos

NutrInvest is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) application. With this application, the user can upload a food picture (e.g.: apple, bread, beef etc.). Once uploaded, the image is sent to an AI database using image classifier. Once the AI identifies the food in the picture, it extracts the nutritional value data. The latter is sent back for the users to view in the interface of the application.
