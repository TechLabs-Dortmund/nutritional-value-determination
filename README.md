# Nutritional Value Determination with Photos

NutrInvest is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) application. With this application, the user can upload a food picture (e.g.: apple, bread, beef etc.). Once uploaded, the image is sent to an AI database using image classifier. Once the AI identifies the food in the picture, it extracts the nutritional value data. The latter is sent back for the users to view in the interface of the application. 

## How to Setup and Run

git clone the project into a repository of your choice. The .net backend is located in /backend/catalog, run it with a .net service of your choice. You also need a MongoDB database running to use the backend. The frontend is located in frontend/nutrient-app, you need to have Angular installed and then run 'npm install' and 'ng serve' in that folder to run the app.
## Examples

Login to the app or register as a new user, then upload an image of food to have it analyzed and get a table showing the nutrient data of your food
